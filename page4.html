<p align="center"><b>What is Data Journalism?</b></p>
<p>Data journalism is the use of data, specifically numerical data in journalism to reveal, better explain and/or provide context to a news story.
 It often relies on the use of charts, graphs and infographics while interacting with several other fields such as statistics and computer science.<br><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Is CityRail providing Quality Service to their Customers?</b></p>
   
<p>In many cities, transportation is the key to keeping a city moving. It is what allows individuals to get from A to B within a short timeframe and grants 
 individuals the ability to work in a place far from home. The Sydney railway network is currently at capacity as of 2018 due to the fact that their railway 
 system and infrastructure has not been expanded enough over the last 50 years. As a result, customers are experiencing indefinite delays on multiple lines.<br><br>

<p align="center"><b>What is the Latte Line and why is it important?</b></p>
<p>The Latte Line is the term used to describe a line which diagonally separates Sydney via economic status, running from Sydney's North-West Airport through Paramatta 
 to Maroubra.<br><br> 
 The north side of the imaginary line represents the wealthy side while the south side represents the economically disadvantaged side. More jobs are being created
 on the north side especially white collar jobs while residential buildings are being constructed on the south side.<br><br> 
 In essence, the peak hour rush results in a
 back and forth crossing of the latte line which causes unemployment, congestion and overcrowding of areas. Therefore, we must understand which areas of Sydney requires improvement
 on both the railway system and infrastructure such as the train terminus.<br><br></p>
