<p align="center"><b>What is Data Journalism?</b></p>
<p>Data journalism is the use of data, specifically numerical data in journalism to reveal, better explain and/or provide context to a news story.
 It often relies on the use of charts, graphs and infographics while interacting with several other fields such as statistics and computer science.<br><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Is CityRail providing Quality Service to their Customers?</b></p>
   
<p>In many cities, transportation is the key to keeping a city moving. It is what allows individuals to get from A to B within a short timeframe and grants 
 individuals the ability to work in a place far from home. In the year 2012, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that Cityrail was ranked as the fourth worst public train system, 
 has Cityrail stepped up their game or have they remained dormant?<br><br>

<p align="center"><b>What is the Latte Line and why is it important?</b></p>
<p>The Latte Line is the term used to describe a line which diagonally separates Sydney via economic status, running from Sydney's North-West Airport through Paramatta 
 to Maroubra.<br><br> 
 The north side of the imaginary line represents the wealthy side while the south side represents the economically disadvantaged side. More jobs are being created
 on the north side especially white collar jobs while residential buildings are being constructed on the south side.<br><br> 
 In essence, the peak hour rush results in a
 back and forth crossing of the latte line which causes unemployment, congestion and overcrowding of areas. Therefore, we must understand which areas of Sydney requires improvement
 on both the railway system and infrastructure such as the train terminus.<br><br></p>

<p align="center"><b>So why is Cityrail doing so bad?</b></p>
<p>The map above shows the hotspots where the majority of people lineup to catch the train to work. Looking at the map we can see that the major hotspots include: Central, Penrith, 
 Blacktown, Cabramatta, Paramatta, Homebush and Chatswood. All of these stations with the exception of Homebush act as a train terminus which allows it to compensate for peak hour rushes and support a back and forth rail system.<br><br>
 However, the primary reason why Cityrail's train network is failing is due to the fact that their railway system and infrastructure are outdated at all of these locations. The Sydney railway network is currently at capacity as of 2018 
 due to the fact that their railway system and infrastructure has not been expanded enough over the last 50 years.<br><br>
 As a result, customers are experiencing indefinite delays on multiple lines. We can also see that the majority of customers reside in the southern side of the Latte line
 which illustrates that the majority travel from the south to the north side to work.<br><br></p>
