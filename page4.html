<p align="center"><b>What is Data Journalism?</b></p>
<p>Data journalism is the use of data, specifically numerical data in journalism to reveal, better explain and/or provide context to a news story.
 It often relies on the use of charts, graphs and infographics while interacting with several other fields such as statistics and computer science.<br><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>A Good Example of Data Journalism</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Where do People Catch the Train from?</b></p>
   
<p>In many cities, transportation is the key to keeping a city moving. It is what allows individuals to get from A to B within a short timeframe and grants 
 individuals the ability to work in a place far from home. If we can identify the popular areas where people catch the train we can improve the infrastructure
 and provide more trains to improve customer service and reduce delays. This information would be especially helpful to CityRail in their pursuit to design a 
 Railway System that satisfies the customers needs.<br><br>

 <p align="center"><b>Dataset</b></p>
 <p>The data used in the website was collected from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) website. The dataset aims to separate the Method of Travel to work by Sex
  by all people over the age of 15 years. This dataset allows individuals to determine which forms of transportation is popular and where transportation can be improved
  in NSW.<br><br></p>

<p align="center"><b>What is the Latte Line and why is it important?</b></p>
<p>The Latte Line is the term used to describe a line which diagonally separates Sydney via economic status, running from Sydney's North-West Airport through Paramatta 
 to Maroubra.<br><br> 
 The north side of the imaginary line represents the wealthy side while the south side represents the economically disadvantaged side. More jobs are being created
 on the north side especially white collar jobs while residential buildings are being constructed on the south side.<br><br> 
 In essence, the peak hour rush results in a
 back and forth crossing of the latte line which causes unemployment, congestion and overcrowding of areas. Therefore, we must understand which areas of Sydney requires improvement
 on both the railway system and infrastructure such as the train terminus.<br><br></p>

<p>The map below reveals hotspots where the majority of people lineup to catch the train to work.<br><br></p>

<p align="center"><b>Which Stations Need Improvement?</b></p>
<p>The map above reveals hotspots where the majority of people lineup to catch the train to work. Looking at the maps both above and below we can see that the major hotspots include: Central, Penrith, 
 Blacktown, Cabramatta, Paramatta, Homebush and Chatswood. All of these stations with the exception of Homebush act as a train terminus which allows it to compensate for peak hour rushes and support a back and forth rail system.<br><br></p>

 <p align="center"><b>A Closer Look</b></p>
 <p>Why do we need to improve these stations? The image to the left shows TripView which is an app used to keep track of CityRail train services, several delays on the airport line to Central which exceed 100 minutes of waiting time.
 This type of service is unacceptable for a railway system that aims to provide quality service to their customers. <br><br>These delays can result in frustration, congestion
 and unemployment which will damage the economy of NSW in the long run. As a result, action must be taken to improve these train stations to decrease delays and improve overall
 customer service.<br><br></p>

<p align="center"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Analysis of hotsposts show that Central, Penrith, Blacktown, Cabramatta, Paramatta, Homebush and Chatswood are the most popular train stations. The majority of the stations lie below
 the south of the latte line. There are many delays according to CityRail's app Tripview and action must be taken to resolve these delays. With this information, Cityrail can focus on improving
 these popular stations and thus the data visualisation aids CityRail in their goal of creating a successful Railway System.
