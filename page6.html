<p align="center"><b>The Problem</b></p>
<p>Delays are a major problem identified in the data visualisation whereby hotspot stations experience massive delays of waiting time.
These delays can result in frustration, congestion and unemployment which will damage the economy of NSW in the long run. 
As a result, action must be taken to improve these train stations to decrease delays and improve overall customer service. <br><br><br>The main reasons why delays occur are
due to trespassing, vandalism, poor weather conditions, trackwork and cable theft.</p><br><br>

 <p><b>Gotthard Base Tunnel</b></p>
 <p>The Gotthard Base Tunnel is a railway tunnel through the Alps of Switzerland. Its full length is 57.09km and is known as the world's
  longest and deepest railway tunnel. <br><br>The primary goal of the tunnel is to increase the local transport capacity by providing a faster
  connection between the canton of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland which reduced the journey time of passengers by an hour.<br><br>After the 
  opening of the tunnel there was an increase of passengers crossing the trans-alpine line, with 2.3 million passengers within the first 8 
  months, which resulted in an increase of 30% over the previous year.

 <p><b>Toronto The Meadoway</b></p>
 <p>Toronto's future project The Meadoway will connect schools, businesses, hospitals, and underused trails through a 16-kilometre stretch of urban 
  greenspace and meadowlands. <br><br>It aims to build a stronger community, create a greener city, provide safer travel methods and access to nature. 
  <br><br>The linear park will become one of Canada's largest national parks and will connect Downtown Toronto to Rouge National Urban Park.

 <p><b>Hong Kong Metro System</b></p>
 <p>The MTR (Mass Transit System) used in Hong Kong's public transport system is one of the most profitable metro systems in the worldwith over five 
  million trips made in an average weekday.<br><br> It consistently achieves a 99.9% on-time rate on its train journeys and is covered from weather issues
  and protected against trespassers due to its tight tunnel system.<br><br>As a successful railway operation to counter the increasing road congestion 
  problem caused by the territory's fast-growing economy, the MTR has served as a model for other newly built systems in the world.

<br><p><b>The Design</b></p>
 <p>In order to reduce delay times, the design should resolve the issues surrounding these delays. Due to the open nature of Sydney's train network it is
  easy for people to trespass onto the tracks to either vandalise or steal cables and materials. The weather also plays a large role in delaying train activity.
  From high winds blowing debris onto the train tracks, fog reducing vision for the train drivers and flood waters damaging cable equipment and tracks, these events
  need to be controlled to reduce trackwork repairs.
