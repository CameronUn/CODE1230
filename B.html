  <p><b>Describe the transformation</b></p>
  <p>The Barangaroo project is an incredibly large urban transformation that went from a once busy shipyard to an urban sprawl of public facilities and private enterprise. <br>The space is divided into 3 precincts, all containing these main components of an urban transformation. Barangaroo South will house the business side or<br> financial services sector, which includes office
     buildings, shops, apartments, public venues, a hotel and a Wynyard transport link. <br><br>Barangaroo Central houses a range of commercial spaces such as a new casino, with various new public facilities, mainly parks and public spaces where community<br> venues can be held. Finally Barangaroo reserve is a 6 hectare open parkland available to the public, this spot features a 
     pedestrian track<br> that loops all the way to the rocks, and presents various lookout spots and places to hold public events. Barangaroo is an incredibly<br> large complex, that is still in development, mainly the central location, which will generate large amounts of activity and profit,<br> but the south and reserve are complete and have been very successful.</p><br>

  <p><b>Identify groups that were in favour of the transformation and those who opposed</b></p>
  <p>This development is positioned within the CBD and therefore community disruption complaints won’t typically occur, and the groups backing the projects are groups associated with<br> the development of it. But the groups that are in favour of the development are City of Sydney, Barangaroo delivery authority, Lendlease, Brookfield, Multiplex, Mirvac,<br> Crown Resorts and Houston Group 
     which is a company that promotes the development.<br><br> A few groups disagree with the production such as the Barangaroo Action Group<br> which are a community based group protesting against the size of the project. Other groups include The National Trust opposing the demolition of the<br> Harbour Control Tower, and the owner of the Star Casino complex disagrees with the development as new 
     bigger crown competition is being built<br> literally across the harbour. There are other environmental and trust groups moving against it due to it being built over a historical sector, which is a<br> standard occurrence as not everyone will disagree with the modernisation of a space with old infrastructure.</p><br>

  <p><b>Identify the arguments made by different groups</b></p>
  <p>The Barangaroo delivery authority is the primary source of the development of the Barangaroo project and is the center of business opportunity.<br><br>
     The city of Sydney supports the development of the Barangaroo project as further industrial development and the potential to sustain and house an increasing population<br> is mutually beneficial for the Sydney council as well as the Barangaroo delivery authority.The Houston group is in support for the Barangaroo project as it<br> helps promote and advertise the area to attract a growing population. 
     Lendlease, Brookfield, Multiplex, Mirvac are businesses involved in the development and receive a<br> very large monetary gain and reputational gain or loss for the development due to the sheer size of it. Crown resorts will ultimately generate the<br> most profit and growth for the development, largely through tourism with Sydney’s biggest casino and first ever 6 star hotel complex.<br><br> 
     The Barangaroo action group was specifically formed to protest against the enormity of the project and to raise awareness of the inability to<br> meet infrastructure demands. But basically they are a group that was formed at the beginning of project planning and essentially criticizes the existence and nature<br> of how the space was created and basically slam the government for simply allowing the 
     corporate entity of Lendlease to have complete control of the space. <br>Other groups pose arguments that disagree with the demolition of historical buildings around the urban space, and finally The Star CEO poses the<br> argument that it creates direct competition with them.</p><br>
