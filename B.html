 <p><b>Describe the transformation</b></p>
   
 <p>The Barangaroo project is an incredibly large urban transformation that went from a once busy shipyard to an urban sprawl of public facilities and private enterprise. The space is divided into 3 precincts, all containing these main components of an urban transformation. Barangaroo South will house the business side or financial services sector, which includes office
     buildings, shops, apartments, public venues, a hotel and a Wynyard transport link.<br><br> Barangaroo Central houses a range of commercial spaces such as a new casino, with various new public facilities, mainly parks and public spaces where community venues can be held. Finally Barangaroo reserve is a 6 hectare open parkland available to the public, this spot features a 
     pedestrian track that loops all the way to the rocks, and presents various lookout spots and places to hold public events. Barangaroo is an incredibly large complex, that is still in development, mainly the central location, which will generate large amounts of activity and profit, but the south and reserve are complete and have been very successful.</p>

 <p>Commercial and Public: The design has changed significantly over the course of the development. The green space has been reduced and the height of the buildings have incresed with more commercial influence.</p>

 <p><b>Groups in Favour</b></p>
 
  <p>This development is positioned within the CBD and therefore community disruption complaints won’t typically occur, and the groups backing the projects are groups associated with the development of it. But the groups that are in favour of the development are City of Sydney, Barangaroo delivery authority, Lendlease, Brookfield, Multiplex, Mirvac,<br> Crown Resorts and Houston Group 
     which is a company that promotes the development. A few groups disagree with the production such as the Barangaroo Action Group which are a community based group protesting against the size of the project.<br><br> Other groups include The National Trust opposing the demolition of the Harbour Control Tower, and the owner of the Star Casino complex disagrees with the development as new 
     bigger crown competition is being built literally across the harbour. There are other environmental and trust groups moving against it due to it being built over a historical sector, which is a standard occurrence as not everyone will disagree with the modernisation of a space with old infrastructure.</p>

 </div>
 
<div>
 
  <p><b>Identify the Arguments made by Different Groups</b></p>
 
  <p>The Barangaroo delivery authority is the primary source of the development of the Barangaroo project and is the center of business opportunity.
     The city of Sydney supports the development of the Barangaroo project as further industrial development and the potential to sustain and house an increasing population is mutually beneficial for the Sydney council as well as the Barangaroo delivery authority.The Houston group is in support for the Barangaroo project as it helps promote and advertise the area to attract a growing population.<br><br> 
     Lendlease, Brookfield, Multiplex, Mirvac are businesses involved in the development and receive a very large monetary gain and reputational gain or loss for the development due to the sheer size of it. Crown resorts will ultimately generate the most profit and growth for the development, largely through tourism with Sydney’s biggest casino and first ever 6 star hotel complex.
     The Barangaroo action group was specifically formed to protest against the enormity of the project and to raise awareness of the inability to meet infrastructure demands.<br><br> But basically they are a group that was formed at the beginning of project planning and essentially criticizes the existence and nature of how the space was created and basically slam the government for simply allowing the 
     corporate entity of Lendlease to have complete control of the space. Other groups pose arguments that disagree with the demolition of historical buildings around the urban space, and finally The Star CEO poses the argument that it creates direct competition with them.</p><br>
