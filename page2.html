<h1>Urban Transformations</h1><br><br>

  <p><b>Definition of an Urban Transformation</b></p>
  <p>An urban design project designed by a group of people to achieve multiple tasks. It is no bigger than the city itself,<br> nor smaller than a single building. Itâ€™s aim is to provide a functional and efficient landscape to provide a space for industry<br> and public to utilise and achieve a collection of varied outcomes.
     The two transformations; Barangaroo and Green Square present two varied examples<br> of modern urban transformations, where an unused or inefficiently used space is transformed into an urban landmark, with public and private facilities.</p><br>
  
  <p><b>Why do the Examples Meet the Definition</b></p>
  <p>They represent a complete alteration of a space no bigger than the city or a single building and provide a landscape that is used by industry<br> and the public. Barangaroo is a space that was transformed completely, a once inefficient use of space alongside a prime location, it is a public space<br> that is inhabited with 
     industry, public space like walkways, facilities, parklands, industry such as shops and office buildings, and a soon to be casino. </p>
  <p>Green Square Plaza is a complete transformation to make the suburb a community hub, creating a space full of public facilities to increase<br> the awareness and activity in an almost forgotten suburb. Both urban transformations intend to create a space to improve social behavior and movement<br> efficiency, and therefore achieving 
     a display of various outcomes.</p><br>
