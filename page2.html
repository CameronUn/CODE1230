<h1>Urban Transformations</h1>

<br><p><b>Billy Park, Cameron Un, Kurtis Watts</b><br><br>An urban design project designed by a group of people to achieve multiple tasks. It is no bigger than the city itself, nor smaller than a single building.<br>It’s aim is to provide a functional and efficient landscape to provide a space for industry and public to utilise and achieve a collection of varied outcomes.<br><br>
The two transformations; Barangaroo and George Street present two varied examples of modern urban transformations,<br>where an unused or inefficiently used space is transformed into an urban landmark, with public and private facilities.<br><br><br>
<b>George Street Light Rail</b>

<p><b>Why is it an Urban Transformation?</b><br><br>The NSW Government has invested $2.1 billion dollars into a light rail project for George Street.<br>It will provide easy access for transportation between The Rocks and Circular Quay<br>to the city centre's retail heart and down to Chinatown.
