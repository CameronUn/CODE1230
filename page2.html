  <p align="center"><b>Definition of an Urban Transformation</b></p>
  <p>An urban design project designed by a group of people to achieve multiple tasks. It is no bigger than the city itself, nor smaller than a single building. It’s aim is to provide a functional and efficient landscape to provide a space for industry and public to utilise and achieve a collection of varied outcomes.
     The two transformations; Barangaroo and Green Square present two varied examples of modern urban transformations, where an unused or inefficiently used space is transformed into an urban landmark, with public and private facilities.<br><br>

    <p><b>Why do the Examples Meet the Definition</b></p>
  
    <p>They represent a complete alteration of a space no bigger than the city or a single building and provide a landscape that is used by industry and the public. Barangaroo is a space that was transformed completely, a once inefficient use of space alongside a prime location, it is a public space that is inhabited with 
     industry, public space like walkways, facilities, parklands, industry such as shops and office buildings, and a soon to be casino.<br>
     Green Square Plaza is a complete transformation to make the suburb a community hub, creating a space full of public facilities to increase the awareness and activity in an almost forgotten suburb. Both urban transformations intend to create a space to improve social behavior and movement efficiency, and therefore achieving 
     a display of various outcomes.</p>

    <p><b>How the Transformation might be Assessed</b></p>
    
     <p>To measure the easiest success of the transformation would be to compare it to the original goal of the project. Does it achieve the projects mission statement and projected outcomes? Best ways to assess this would be with community surveys. Feedback from media sources such as journal articles and news segments can also 
     contribute towards the social feedback. Did the project come within the timeline and cost of the original estimate? Data driven approaches to measuring the success would to be to monitor the pedestrian movements in and around the projects. How long does a person stay in the area? What is the retail revenue of the surrounding commercial elements in project? Transport data from services such as Opal could show the use of travel to area.
     Social media data can also be used towards measuring the success, collecting all mentions, tags and location data from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can help measure the popularity of the area. Other issues that could be assessed would be the environmental impact of the development. Have the native populations of wildlife returned or left the area? What is the quality of the resources such as air and water? Is the quality of life increased or decreased? Using a measure of perceived stress surveys to measure the stress in the 
     area over a period of time could help collect data on the outcome of a transformation. Has there been much crime or violence in the area relating to the transformation?</p>
