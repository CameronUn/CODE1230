<h1>Urban Transformations</h1><br><br>

  <p><b>Definition of an Urban Transformation</b></p>
  <p>An urban design project designed by a group of people to achieve multiple tasks. It is no bigger than the city itself,<br> nor smaller than a single building. Itâ€™s aim is to provide a functional and efficient landscape to provide a space for industry<br> and public to utilise and achieve a collection of varied outcomes.
     The two transformations; Barangaroo and Green Square present two varied examples<br> of modern urban transformations, where an unused or inefficiently used space is transformed into an urban landmark, with public and private facilities.</p><br>
  
  <p><b>Why do the Examples Meet the Definition</b></p>
  <p>They represent a complete alteration of a space no bigger than the city or a single building and provide a landscape that is used by industry<br> and the public. Barangaroo is a space that was transformed completely, a once inefficient use of space alongside a prime location, it is a public space<br> that is inhabited with 
     industry, public space like walkways, facilities, parklands, industry such as shops and office buildings, and a soon to be casino. </p>
  <p>Green Square Plaza is a complete transformation to make the suburb a community hub, creating a space full of public facilities to increase<br> the awareness and activity in an almost forgotten suburb. Both urban transformations intend to create a space to improve social behavior and movement<br> efficiency, and therefore achieving 
     a display of various outcomes.</p><br>
  
  <p><b>Explain how the success of the transformation might be assessed, and what data might be needed to assess it</b></p>
  <p>To measure the easiest success of the transformation would be to compare it to the original mission goal of the project. Does it achieve the<br> projects mission statement and projected outcomes? Best ways to assess this would be with community surveys. Feedback from media sources such as journal articles and<br> news segments can also 
     contribute towards the social feedback.</p>
  <p>Did the project come within the timeline and cost of the original estimate?
     Data driven approaches to measuring the success would to be to monitor the pedestrian movements in and<br> around the projects. How long does a person stay in the area? What is the retail revenue of the surrounding<br> commercial elements in project? Transport data from services such as Opal could show the use of travel to area.
     Social media data can also be used towards<br> measuring the success, collecting all mentions, tags and location data from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can help measure the popularity of the area.</p>
  <p>Other issues that could be assessed would be the environmental impact of the development. Have the native populations of wildlife returned or left the area?<br> What is the quality of the resources such as air and water? Is the quality of life increased or decreased? Using a measure of perceived<br> stress surveys to measure the stress in the 
     area over a period of time could help collect data on the outcome of a transformation.</p><br>
