  <p><b>Describe the transformation</b></p>
  <p>The Green Square Project is an $8 billion investment on a 14 hectare block of land. The space will hold a public library and plaza,<br> aquatic and recreation centre, community cultural precinct, parks and public art. There are also various private developments including retail and hotel infrastructure that will generate<br> revenue for the area. 
     These public centres feature two architecturally designed spaces, the public library and aquatic center, in order to generate more functional community<br> spaces and also increase human activity within the area.</p><br>

  <p><b>Identify groups that were in favour of the transformation and those who opposed</b></p>
  <p>The main groups in favour of the development within environment are the people involved with planning, designing and building the development, these include City of Sydney,<br> Sydney Water Corporation, Landcom and the crown group, along with the architects chosen to design the space which are Stewart Hollenstein and ABA Architects. City<br> of Sydney is 
     a government sector that develop and organise urban transformations within Sydney and aim to improve current landscapes and most people that disagree<br> are local communities in this case that rains true.<br><br> The local community of Green Square don’t necessarily disagree with end product but with the production<br> due to increased traffic and noise pollution 
     in the area. A community based group called ‘Friends of Erskineville’ also disagree due to fears of overcrowding<br> within the area due to projected population increase. Basically there isn’t a complete disagreement of the end product because at the end of the day<br> it is public facility and will provide a modern community space for local residents and others.</p><br>


 
  <p><b>Identify the arguments made by different groups</b></p>
  <p>The city of Sydney supports the urban transformation of green square for business and potential development opportunities for the growing Sydney population, as ultimately in <br>order to develop a city further infrastructure like this is essential. Sydney Water Corporation has gotten substantial business opportunity through developing the drainage systems for<br> 
     the property developments. Landcom is developing the Green Square town center which is significantly important to assisting the thriving population that the city of Sydney<br> is developing land for. It is a necessity which provides adequate infrastructure for a thriving community, providing housing, transport and employment.<br><br>
     Crown group has taken this development opportunity to build luxury apartments in order to generate further business and expand their presence within the city. <br>The two architecture firms on the job receive reputational gain or loss plus a monetary injection once the design process is complete. 
     The local community is opposed to the idea of the green square project<br> and individuals have  discussed the noise complaints and traffic congestion which doesn’t<br> seem to cater for the potential growth of the area due to the new developments set in place by the council.<br><br> The friends of Erskineville is a group within the local community which discuss and raise the 
     concern of the public about the green square project. These concerns mostly include the government’s inability<br> to keep up with the demands of infrastructure to accommodate for the surge in projected population. This population increase is inevitable and<br> is the developers intent when creating this space, as the project in itself is to increase human activity within the area.</p><br><br><br>
