  <br><br><br><p><b>Describe the transformation</b></p>
  
  <p>The Green Square Project is an $8 billion investment on a 14 hectare block of land. The space will hold a public library and plaza, aquatic and recreation centre, community cultural precinct, parks and public art.<br><br> There are also various private developments including retail and hotel infrastructure that will generate revenue for the area. 
     These public centres feature two architecturally designed spaces, the public library and aquatic center, in order to generate more functional community spaces and also increase human activity within the area.</p>

 <p>Above and Underground Design: Most of the entire library space was moved underground completely and within the small rectangular building, and this allows a lot more open space above ground for the public to congregate on.</p>

 <p>The library complex simply uses  big glass simple geometrical structures which stands out amongst surrounding buildings, they are also randomly sticking out of the ground.  The aquatic centre features an open plan design that flows seamlessly between each section, whilst maintaining an aesthetic look.</p>

The sections are placed in a manner that allows easy access in one straight section along 3 blocks, with a park separating the two main places of the environment. This strip was designed with the intent of flow, these spaces all integrate well with each segement remaining in walking distance from each other, allowing these public transformations to be pedestrian friendly.</p>

 <p><b>Groups in Favour</b></p>
 <p>The main groups in favour of the development within environment are the people involved with planning, designing and building the development, these include City of Sydney, Sydney Water Corporation, Landcom and the crown group, along with the architects chosen to design the space which are Stewart Hollenstein and ABA Architects. City of Sydney is 
     a government sector that develop and organise urban transformations within Sydney and aim to improve current landscapes and most people that disagree are local communities in this case that rains true.<br><br>The local community of Green Square don’t necessarily disagree with end product but with the production due to increased traffic and noise pollution 
     in the area. A community based group called ‘Friends of Erskineville’ also disagree due to fears of overcrowding within the area due to projected population increase. Basically there isn’t a complete disagreement of the end product because at the end of the day it is public facility and will provide a modern community space for local residents and others.</p>

<!--   <p><b>Identify the arguments made by different groups</b></p>
  <p>The city of Sydney supports the urban transformation of green square for business and potential development opportunities for the growing Sydney population, as ultimately in <br>order to develop a city further infrastructure like this is essential. Sydney Water Corporation has gotten substantial business opportunity through developing the drainage systems for<br> 
     the property developments. Landcom is developing the Green Square town center which is significantly important to assisting the thriving population that the city of Sydney<br> is developing land for. It is a necessity which provides adequate infrastructure for a thriving community, providing housing, transport and employment.<br><br>
     Crown group has taken this development opportunity to build luxury apartments in order to generate further business and expand their presence within the city. <br>The two architecture firms on the job receive reputational gain or loss plus a monetary injection once the design process is complete. 
     The local community is opposed to the idea of the green square project<br> and individuals have  discussed the noise complaints and traffic congestion which doesn’t<br> seem to cater for the potential growth of the area due to the new developments set in place by the council.<br><br> The friends of Erskineville is a group within the local community which discuss and raise the 
     concern of the public about the green square project. These concerns mostly include the government’s inability<br> to keep up with the demands of infrastructure to accommodate for the surge in projected population. This population increase is inevitable and<br> is the developers intent when creating this space, as the project in itself is to increase human activity within the area.</p><br><br><br></p> -->
